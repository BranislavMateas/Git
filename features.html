            <h1 class="nadpis">Branching and Merging</h1>
            <p>
               The Git feature that really makes it stand apart from nearly every
               other SCM out there is its branching model.<br /><br />
               Git allows and encourages you to have multiple local branches that can
               be entirely independent of each other. The creation, merging, and
               deletion of those lines of development takes seconds. <br /><br />
            </p>
            <ul>
               <p>This means that you can do things like:</p>
               <li>
                  <strong>Frictionless Context Switching.</strong> Create a branch to
                  try out an idea, commit a few times, switch back to where you
                  branched from, apply a patch, switch back to where you are
                  experimenting, and merge it in.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Role-Based Codelines.</strong> Have a branch that always
                  contains only what goes to production, another that you merge work
                  into for testing, and several smaller ones for day to day work.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Feature Based Workflow.</strong> Create new branches for
                  each new feature you're working on so you can seamlessly switch back
                  and forth between them, then delete each branch when that feature
                  gets merged into your main line.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Disposable Experimentation.</strong> Create a branch to
                  experiment in, realize it's not going to work, and just delete it -
                  abandoning the work—with nobody else ever seeing it (even if you've
                  pushed other branches in the meantime).
               </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="flex-container">
               <p style="width: 700px">
                  Notably, when you push to a remote repository, you do not have to
                  push all of your branches. You can choose to share just one of your
                  branches, a few of them, or all of them. This tends to free people
                  to try new ideas without worrying about having to plan how and when
                  they are going to merge it in or share it with others.<br /><br />
                  There are ways to accomplish some of this with other systems, but
                  the work involved is much more difficult and error-prone. Git makes
                  this process incredibly easy and it changes the way most developers
                  work when they learn it.

            <h1 class="nadpis">Data Assurance</h1>
            <p>
               The data model that Git uses ensures the cryptographic integrity of
               every bit of your project. Every file and commit is checksummed and
               retrieved by its checksum when checked back out. It's impossible to
               get anything out of Git other than the
               <strong>exact bits you put in.</strong>
            </p>
            <div class="flex-container">
               <p style="width: 700px; padding-top: 150px">
                  It is also impossible to change any file, date, commit message, or
                  any other data in a Git repository without changing the IDs of
                  everything after it. This means that if you have a commit ID, you
                  can be assured not only that your project is exactly the same as
                  when it was committed, but that nothing in its history was changed.
                  <br /><br />
                  Most centralized version control systems provide no such integrity
                  by default. work when they learn it.

            </div>
            <h1 class="nadpis">Staging Area</h1>
            <p>
               Unlike the other systems, Git has something called the "staging area"
               or "index". This is an intermediate area where commits can be
               formatted and reviewed before completing the commit.<br /><br />
               One thing that sets Git apart from other tools is that it's possible
               to quickly stage some of your files and commit them without committing
               all of the other modified files in your working directory or having to
               list them on the command line during the commit.
            </p>
            <div class="flex-container">
               <p style="width: 700px; padding-top: 100px">
                  This allows you to stage only portions of a modified file. Gone are
                  the days of making two logically unrelated modifications to a file
                  before you realized that you forgot to commit one of them. Now you
                  can just stage the change you need for the current commit and stage
                  the other change for the next commit. This feature scales up to as
                  many different changes to your file as needed.

            <h1 class="nadpis">Small and Fast</h1>
            <p>
               <strong>Git is fast.</strong> With Git, nearly all operations are
               performed locally, giving it a huge speed advantage on centralized
               systems that constantly have to communicate with a server
               somewhere.<br /><br />
               Git was built to work on the Linux kernel, meaning that it has had to
               effectively handle large repositories from day one. Git is written in
               C, reducing the overhead of runtimes associated with higher-level
               languages. Speed and performance has been a primary design goal of the
               Git from the start.<br /><br />
               Let's see how common operations stack up against Subversion, a common
               centralized version control system that is similar to CVS or Perforce.
               <em>Smaller is faster.</em>
            </p>
            <img width="100%" src="./images/benchmark.png" alt="Benchmark" />
            <p>
               For testing, large AWS instances were set up in the same availability
               zone. Git and SVN were installed on both machines, the Ruby repository
               was copied to both Git and SVN servers, and common operations were
               performed on both.<br />
               <br />
               In some cases the commands don't match up exactly. Here, matching on
               the lowest common denominator was attempted. For example, the 'commit'
               tests also include the time to push for Git, though most of the time
               you would not actually be pushing to the server immediately after a
               commit where the two commands cannot be separated in SVN.<br /><br />
               All of these times are in seconds.

               Note that this is the best case scenario for SVN—a server with no load
               with a gigabit connection to the client machine. Nearly all of these
               times would be even worse for SVN if that connection was slower, while
               many of the Git times would not be affected. <br /><br />Clearly, in
               many of these common version control operations,
               <strong>Git is one or two orders of magnitude faster than SVN</strong
                  >, even under ideal conditions for SVN.<br /><br />
               One place where Git is slower is in the initial clone operation. Here,
               Git is downloading the entire history rather than only the latest
               version. As seen in the above charts, it's not considerably slower for
               an operation that is only performed once.

               It's also interesting to note that the size of the data on the client
               side is very similar even though Git also has every version of every
               file for the entire history of the project. This illustrates how
               efficient it is at compressing and storing data on the client side.
