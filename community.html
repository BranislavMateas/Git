                  Bugs in git can be reported directly to the mailing list (see above
                  for details). Note that you do not need to subscribe to the list to
                  send to it. You can help us out by attempting to reproduce the bug
                  in the latest released version of git, or if you're willing to build
                  git from source, the

                  which case your feedback as to whether the fix worked for you will
                  be appreciated. <br /><br />If you are using git 2.27.0 or later,

                  server <strong>(irc.freenode.net)</strong>. These channels are
                  regularly filled with hundreds of people who are all very

                  and might be able to help you contribute to Git. <br /><br />If you
                  need specific help about one of the for-profit Git hosting sites,
                  you might try their own IRC channels (such as
                  <mark>#github</mark> or <mark>#gitlab</mark>) on the same IRC
