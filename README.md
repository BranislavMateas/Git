# HI! THIS IS MY GIT'S WEBSITE REDESIGN.
So, basically, this was my "output" from HTML/CSS theme which we study at school. I had this idea, when I was self-studying Git and saw their website - It deserves better! So, I tried to make my turn.

I have finished this project in a week, as I had a deadline but I am planning currently to improve this website and make it responsible and add there some Javascript (I want to add animations)

### See ya!
